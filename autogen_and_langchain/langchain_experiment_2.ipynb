      "#### 1. **Project Title:**\n",
      "The title is clear and concise. It effectively communicates the purpose of the project.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 2. **Project Objectives:**\n",
      "The objectives are well-defined, but I suggest including specific metrics for success. For example, defining what constitutes \"high accuracy\" (e.g., 95% detection accuracy) will help measure the project's success more effectively. Additionally, consider including objectives related to user satisfaction and ease of use of the interface.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 3. **Project Scope:**\n",
      "The scope is clearly delineated. However, it may be beneficial to clarify whether any modifications to the existing camera systems are permissible if they are minimal and necessary for integration. Furthermore, consider including a section on potential extensions or future phases of the project (e.g., expanding to mobile applications or integrating with access control systems).\n",

      "### Conclusion\n",
      "Currently, the calculated effort to secure the face mask detection system is 0 days, as there are no vulnerabilities identified at this time. However, proactive measures should still be taken to evaluate and enhance the system’s security posture continuously. Regular assessments and updates will help mitigate risks and ensure the system remains secure against emerging threats.\n",
